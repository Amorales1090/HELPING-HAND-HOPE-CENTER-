My name is Alexander Morales and I am the proud owner of 
Helping-Hands-&-Hope-Center. I Opened this center because, There are so many people out there, That are not getting the help that they need, Or deserve. I myself needed help, and honestly I didn't know where to go, Who to ask, and sometimes it's embarrassing. So I created this center to help everyone in my path from help with resources that they may need in their life. and helping with  paperwork/application and talking them through it, Our center is going to offer everyone the resources that they need! no matter what it is! Now I am just starting off but I have big goals and ambitions for everyone Our center is going to offer more and more as we grow. Helping file paperwork and understanding the paperwork, helping with home cost, grocery pickup, food, home Care/maintenance, one on one counseling, 24-hour hotline and much much more. Now as I mentioned earlier I'm just starting Helping hands & Hope center. And I will be filing federal and state grants to help all of you all donations are welcome, and let's make today & tomorrow a better day
